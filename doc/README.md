# Chrome Password Decryptor ðŸ’»ðŸ”“

## Overview
This project is a C++ application designed to decrypt saved passwords from Google Chrome's 'Login Data' file, utilizing the encrypted key stored in Chrome's 'Local State' file.

### Objectives
- Extract the encrypted key from the 'Local State' file.
- Decrypt the key using Windows Data Protection API (DPAPI).
- Decrypt passwords from the 'Login Data' file using the decrypted key.

## Implementation
The project uses C++ and incorporates various libraries alongside Windows-specific APIs.

### Key Features
- Extraction and Base64 decoding of the encrypted key.
- Decryption of the key using DPAPI.
- Decoding and decrypting of saved passwords in Chrome.

## Current Status
ðŸš§ Under development.

## Prerequisites
- Windows OS.
- Google Chrome.
- C++ development tools.

## Dependencies and Installation

### Dependencies
